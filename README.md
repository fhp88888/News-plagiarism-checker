# News-plagiarism-checker
This project is aimed at checking plagiarism news stories.
Everyone read the news. 
But I come to realize that much news from media IS NOT written by their own hands, instead simply by "Ctrl-C" and "Ctrl-v". 
They only add a few words and the whole news becomes "their story". 
This is ridiculous!
RIDICULOUS!
So I created this project aimed at checking plagiarism news stories. 
I hate people plagiarism others' work, and I hope this project can help to restrain this phenomenon.
